## Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I'm a software engineer that likes to dabble in a lot of different projects, languages, and environments.

🐷 Recently I've been working mostly on an OS called [Bits Runner](https://github.com/rafalgrodzinski/bits-runner), which aims to be a preemptive, support user mode, virtual memory and all that sufff. Since doing it in the usual sytem language is boring, I'm also creating a programming language called [Bits Runner Code](https://github.com/rafalgrodzinski/bits-runner-builder), which is a modern take on the C language, built on top of LLVM.

⌨ Professionally I do mostly mobile development for both iOS and Android, but personally I play around with lots of different stuff, so I have projects done in various different languages, such as C++, Swift, Assembly, TypeScript, and so on.

🤖 And sorry, you won't find LLM generated code-slop here.
